  summary: "Yttrium is a chemical element with symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a \"rare earth element\". Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element.",
